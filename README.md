# flexbox-editor
Hey everyone,  this is my little project I created to PRACTICE programming skills.
The main idea I follow is "EDITOR" and I chose CSS technology Flexbox to demonstrate the main tasks involved in creating an editor.
The result of this activity should not be just a product that does something, but rather the right programming techniques and their justification in text form.
