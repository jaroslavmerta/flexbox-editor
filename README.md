# flexbox-editor

Hey everyone,  
this is my little project I created to PRACTICE programming skills.  
The main idea I follow is "EDITOR" and I chose CSS technology Flexbox to demonstrate the main tasks involved in creating an editor and in creating any bigger project.
The result of this activity should not be just a product that does something, but rather the right programming techniques and their justification in a text form connected with a practical example as a part of larger whole.  

Download, try, look into codebase, criticize code techniques. You can fork and make some changes or just write me suggestions and I will try to apply them if they are worthy.   Your name will not be forgotten.  
My main part in this is to make description of used techniques including reflection of the changes.  

# apologize
I hope this list below will disappear very soon, because they are basic mistakes I did because I was too hungry to make things work as sooon as possible :-)
- add comments to functions that have no comments (character: lazy programmer)  
- remove functions that will no be used anymore  
- add basic desription of main parts of code  
- make better adresary tree like better names of files and sorting. When I started it was good and it made perfect sense, but things changed from then, but some names not.

# desription
- programming language: typescript
- database: Local storage (funny one, but yes, now it uses local storage, because it needs more advanced database design I am not capable of for now)
